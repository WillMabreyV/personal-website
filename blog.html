                Western is for specific diseases.
                Eastern is for wholistic "diseases".
                Western is for cutting out tumors, vaccinating against specific viruses (e.g., COVID), repairing organ damage, and addressing immediate physical trauma.
                Eastern is for chronic illness lacking clear etiology, psychosomatic issues, malaise, stress, and physical/mental unwellness.
                Western can help address overall wellness and wholistic issues - but does so ,<i>incompletely</i>.
                Eastern can help prevent specific dieseases like cancer, organ damage, and even viral and bacterial disease - but does so <i>preventatively</i> and <i>indirectly</i>.
                If you already have COVID, Eastern medicine will not address the virus directly - however it can help bolster your immune system generally, which helps you fight the virus faster.
                If you get a COVID vaccine, Western medicine has helped you prevent a particular disease - but that won't help you at all with another diseaes, like the flu.

                The answer then, is to combine both. 

                Eastern/wholistic approaches should be applied daily, as they bolster your general wellness (mental health & clarity, physical health & vitality, overall immune system function, etc.).
                This will make you more resistent to <i>any</i> disease, be it cancer, dementia, COVID, flu, ankle sprains, bone fractures, and so on.
                Please understand - this doesn't mean taking a bunch of homepathic herbs you don't believe in, or even doing yoga, or eating an Ayurvedic diet or something like that.
                It <i>can</i> mean that if that vibes with you, but for most of us, we already have wholistic "medicine" we can get behind. These often include:
                - Physical exercise (running, listing weights, playing sports, playing with our pets or kids)
                - Mental exercise (playing games (video games that require mental work, board games, Sudoku, etc.), learning new things (for work, hobbies, artistic creation, building things, or solving life problems (housing market economics, how to be a better parent, etc.)))
                - Physical rest & relaxation (massage, sleeping, napping, chilling & eating)
                - Mental rest & relaxation (sleeping, napping, meditation, prayer taking walks in the sunshine, doing the dishes or some other rote task and letting our mind wander)
                - Nutrition (doesn't have to be Ayurvedic, Mediterranean, Carnivore, Vegan, etc. - just eating in the way that makes you feel best; your stomach, your mental clarity, your energy for the day, your mood)
                - Socializing (hanging with friends & family or work colleagues & mentors, playing games together, talking, joking, learning about them, learning <i>from them</i>, building something together)
                - Spirituality (this can look incredibly different for different people, and often can include multiple of the areas listed above, but the common theme is always a feeling of being "connected with God", feeling like "my self", feeling connected with life/the universe/your greater purpose, etc. - anything that leads you to feeling like you better understand your place in the world & why you're here):
                    > Going to church
                    > Praying
                    > Meditating
                    > Doing a Tough Mudder
                    > Running a marathon
                    > Going to the gym
                    > Watching a truly great TV show or movie
                    > Reading a book that connects with you
                    > Spending time with your loved ones
                    > Meeting a new person / people who you really connect with
                    > Doing work that leaves you feeling full of purpose & even Love (service, artistic creation, structural creation, gardening, creating a product you think people will really benefit from) 
                    > and so on.

                Western should be applied as needed, and diagnostically (both as-needed, "I've had a weird pain in my side for months now!" and preventatively, "Time to get my butthole fingered for science so I don't die an early death").
                [Provide examples/expand? Or is this honestly enough?]

                As you can see, this can be summed up as: live like an early (evolutionary) human, but wash your hands. And maybe wear sunscreen.

                An early human would naturally walk for long hours in nature, do work to build something worthwhile and clearly helpful to oneself and others, create art, spend time with friends and family dancing, making music, playing games, staring at the stars...and then sleeping when tired, and eating whole foods (processed junk didn't exist back in the day).
                BUT, we don't wanna die from simple bacterial infections, or physical trauma that can be fixed by a  skilled medical doctor. Back in the day, if you're head got cracked open on a rock, you would have bled out. If you broke your arm, it would have healed back funny, forever crooked and less useable. If your hands got dirty with animal poop and you were preparing dinner that night for the tribe...at best you would have rinsed them off in the pond or river. Bacteria would still be crawling all over your skin and into the fishmeat you were stripping off the bone and feeding to your children uncooked.
                So, yeah. Do all the wholistic stuff, but wash your hands, and for the love of God please accept Western medical care when you need it - Eastern medicine might prevent cancer on the whole, but Western doctors will detect deep tumors with their fancy techno-instruments and cut them out with surgical precision. No herb will do that, and no witch doctor will detect pancreatic cancer in your palm lines or stool sample.

                [Only inconsistency I see here is that I say Eastern medicine is more for preventative care, whereas Western is more for emergency/when-needed care...I think that's generally true, but obv. Western diagnotic procedures are massively helpful for early detection...Ah, that's it. Routine Western diagnostic procedures don't directly prevent diseases (like Eastern wholistic wellness approaches do), but they CAN prevent disease spreading or worsening due to <i>early detection</i>, which is different from prevention.]
